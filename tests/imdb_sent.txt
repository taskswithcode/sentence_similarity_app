"A rating of ""1"" does not begin to express how dull, depressing and relentlessly bad this movie is."
Hated it with all my being. Worst movie ever. Mentally- scarred. Help me. It was that bad.TRUST ME!!!
"Long, boring, blasphemous. Never have I been so glad to see ending credits roll."
This film made John Glover a star. Alan Raimy is one of the most compelling character that I have ever seen on film. And I mean that sport.
"Were I not with friends, and so cheap, I would have walked out. It failed miserably as satire and didn't even have the redemption of camp."
For pure gothic vampire cheese nothing can compare to the Subspecies films. I highly recommend each and every one of them.
"A great film in its genre, the direction, acting, most especially the casting of the film makes it even more powerful. A must see."
"This is a terrible movie, don't waste your money on it. Don't even watch it for free. That's all I have to say."
I wouldn't rent this one even on dollar rental night.
"More suspenseful, more subtle, much, much more disturbing...."
This is a good film. This is very funny. Yet after this film there were no good Ernest films!
A touching movie. It is full of emotions and wonderful acting. I could have sat through it a second time.
"Great movie - especially the music - Etta James - ""At Last"". This speaks volumes when you have finally found that special someone."
If you've ever had a mad week-end out with your mates then you'll appreciate this film. Excellent fun and a laugh a minute.
"I think it's one of the greatest movies which are ever made, and I've seen many... The book is better, but it's still a very good movie!"
Brilliant and moving performances by Tom Courtenay and Peter Finch.
The characters are unlikeable and the script is awful. It's a waste of the talents of Deneuve and Auteuil.
You've got to be kidding. This movie sucked for the sci-fi fans. I would only recommend watching this only if you think Armageddon was good.
Ten minutes of people spewing gallons of pink vomit. Recurring scenes of enormous piles of dog excrement - need one say more???
"As usual, Sean Connery does a great job. Lawrence Fishburn is good, but I have a hard time not seeing him as Ike Turner."
This movie is terrible but it has some good effects.
You'd better choose Paul Verhoeven's even if you have watched it.
"Brilliant. Ranks along with Citizen Kane, The Matrix and Godfathers. Must see, at least for basset in her early days. Watch it."
"I don't know why I like this movie so well, but I never get tired of watching it."
The one-liners fly so fast in this movie that you can watch it over and over and still catch new ones. By far one of the best of this genre.
"Don't waste your time and money on it. It's not quite as bad as ""Adrenalin"", by the same director but that's not saying much."
"Read the book, forget the movie!"
This is a great movie. Too bad it is not available on home video.
"Very intelligent language usage of Ali, which you musn't miss! In one word: (eeh sentence...) Wicked, so keep it real and pass it on!"
Primary plot!Primary direction!Poor interpretation.
"If you like Pauly Shore, you'll love Son in Law. If you hate Pauly Shore, then, well...I liked it!"
Just love the interplay between two great characters of stage & screen - Veidt & Barrymore
"This movie will always be a Broadway and Movie classic, as long as there are still people who sing, dance, and act."
This is the greatest movie ever. If you have written it off with out ever seeing it. You must give it a second try.
"What a script, what a story, what a mess!"
"I caught this film late at night on HBO. Talk about wooden acting, unbelievable plot, et al. Very little going in its favor. Skip it."
This is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen. It is not funny. It is not interesting and should not have been made.
Ming The Merciless does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!
This is quite possibly the worst sequel ever made. The script is unfunny and the acting stinks. The exact opposite of the original.
"This is the definitive movie version of Hamlet. Branagh cuts nothing, but there are no wasted moments."
My favorite movie. What a great story this really was. I'd just like to be able to buy a copy of it but this does not seem possible.
"Comment this movie is impossible. Is terrible, very improbable, bad interpretation e direction. Not look!!!!!"
"Brilliant movie. The drawings were just amazing. Too bad it ended before it begun. I´ve waited 21 years for a sequel, but nooooo!!!"
a mesmerizing film that certainly keeps your attention... Ben Daniels is fascinating (and courageous) to watch.
"This is a very cool movie. The ending of the movie is a bit more defined than the play's ending, but either way it is still a good movie."
"Without a doubt, one of Tobe Hoppor's best! Epic storytellng, great special effects, and The Spacegirl (vamp me baby!)."
I hope this group of film-makers never re-unites.
Unwatchable. You can't even make it past the first three minutes. And this is coming from a huge Adam Sandler fan!!1
"One of the funniest movies made in recent years. Good characterization, plot and exceptional chemistry make this one a classic"
"Add this little gem to your list of holiday regulars. It is sweet, funny, and endearing"
"no comment - stupid movie, acting average or worse... screenplay - no sense at all... SKIP IT!"
"If you haven't seen this, it's terrible. It is pure trash. I saw this about 17 years ago, and I'm still screwed up from it."
Absolutely fantastic! Whatever I say wouldn't do this underrated movie the justice it deserves. Watch it now! FANTASTIC!
"As a big fan of Tiny Toon Adventures, I loved this movie!!! It was so funny!!! It really captured how cartoons spent their summers."
Widow hires a psychopath as a handyman. Sloppy film noir thriller which doesn't make much of its tension promising set-up. (3/10)
The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu (1980). This is hands down the worst film I've ever seen. What a sad way for a great comedian to go out.
"Obviously written for the stage. Lightweight but worthwhile. How can you go wrong with Ralph Richardson, Olivier and Merle Oberon."
This movie turned out to be better than I had expected it to be. Some parts were pretty funny. It was nice to have a movie with a new plot.
This movie is terrible. It's about some no brain surfin dude that inherits some company. Does Carrot Top have no shame?
Adrian Pasdar is excellent is this film. He makes a fascinating woman.
"An unfunny, unworthy picture which is an undeserving end to Peter Sellers' career. It is a pity this movie was ever made."
"The plot was really weak and confused. This is a true Oprah flick. (In Oprah's world, all men are evil and all women are victims.)"
