do u really want me to unistall this app...whenever i open this app, u ask for review...how many times i have to give review-feedback...
I don't like how it asks to give a review everytime I open the app
Stop asking for review everytime I open the app..it's pathetic..the updated version sucks
If i already provided the review for this application but why this application is asking for reviews every time when I am opening the application so improve this feature. This feature is very irritating. Apart from that overall experience is very good.
as you guys bother me so much for the review even i gave my opinion already but every time i open the app it ask for review so i gave it 1 star , previsiousally it was 4 star.
repeatedly asking to rate the app...
Very irritating. Everytime i open app it asked for review hence giving 2 instead of 4
stop asking for ratings every time when open the app. I had rated this app 5 star but now every time app asking for give rating, its disgusting. so I'll give only one star
I swear if i see that feedback ad one more time im gonna uninstall this app and start using another one else
I'm am downgrading my rating because the app is good and I also gave it 5 satar but why I am getting unnecessary pop up to give it review please fix it
No rating ... worsted app ... please playstore delete this app
Much bad experience . when I used to open the app it requires feedback every time.
I already rated it then why always it pop up... Its irritate me a lot everytime when I open this app... Plz fix this 
This app any time ask me for rating i hate this
Very Good app but asks to rate it all the time....all these popups are annoying when you are in hurry
I'm already rated this app. And now from one week and adove this app is asking for rating please solve the problem as soon as possible. Thank you
The app is too good but it send me notification again and again to rate it that's why am I giving one star to it
Constantly asks me to rate the app! So annoying.
Today again i am go to rating this app due to its ad less and best interface with good features again more 
App is very disturbing .. very bad app
If I don't want to rate it's my personal choice, so why this app gives notification every single time,, it's quite frustrating therefore 1star Other wise app is best for it's work
For frustrating me every time to rate your app

Vey bad app so disturbance ... All time get notification about rating... That allready done
Earlier I had given 5 stars to this app but even after giving review in this app, it speaks to rate now, so I removed 5 stars in edit review and put 1 star, now this app will be happy.
